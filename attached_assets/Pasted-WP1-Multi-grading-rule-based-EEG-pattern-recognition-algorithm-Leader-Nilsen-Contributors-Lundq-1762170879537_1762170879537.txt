Aims and Objectives: A retrospective study using our EEG database is designed to yield an auto-
mated multi-grading rule-based EEG assessment scheme describing and grading normal and patho-
logical EEG patterns controlling for sedative effects.
Task 1.1: Establish project-specific database
A project-specific dataset will be established by combining information on sedation (yes/no) and EEG
features annotated using the SCORE nomenclature in collaboration with Nurse. The combined an-
notation for the EEG recordings will have the following multilevel grading groups: Non-sedated/Non-
malignant, Sedated/Non-malignant, Non-sedated/Highly Malignant, Sedated/Highly Malignant. Here,
the Non-Sedated/Non-Malignant group defines the (Control Group for study Population) good prog-
nosis and the other three groups describe the pathological EEG patterns towards poor prognosis.
Task 1.2: AI model development for assessment of EEG patterns relevant for prognostication
The raw EEGs annotated in Task 1.1 are used to develop three AI-based models: two for binary
classification and one for four-class categorization. The first binary classification model determines
whether the patient is sedated or not, while the second distinguishes between highly malignant and
benign conditions. The third model is a four-class categorization system that classifies EEG data
into one of four categories: non-sedated/non-malignant, sedated/non-malignant, non-sedated/highly
malignant, and sedated/highly malignant.
Transformer networks (TNs) with attention mechanisms (AMs) [19] have recently become prominent
in natural language processing, largely due to their scalability and their ability to build attention maps
that identify correlations between words (tokens). Their versatility and robustness have led to their
adaptation in various advanced applications, including ChatGPT. Given these strengths, TNs present
an intriguing avenue for further exploration of time-series EEG data, as they can be leveraged to
uncover complex patterns and relationships both within individual EEG channels (intra-channel) and
between different channels (inter-channel).
In our approach, we will segment EEG recordings into n-second windows, transforming these seg-
ments into tokens. This allows our customized TN to process the data and build an attention maps.
Tokenization of segments facilitates TN to identify complex correlations within the EEG signals. To
capture the complex relationships within EEG data, the AM can be customized to focus on both lo-
cal and global interactions. This involves creating a multi-head AM of TN where different heads are

designed to analyze localized patterns within adjacent segments as well as broader patterns across
multiple segments. Additionally, considering that EEG data are collected from multiple channels
(electrodes), the AM can be tailored to emphasize inter-channel relationships, allowing the model to
prioritize and learn from the most informative channels for specific neurological conditions.

These patients are treated with mechanical ventilation and sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) demanding substantial additional medical resources due to their complex care requirements. Continuing or withdrawing treatment based on multimodal prognostication using clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical markers and neuroimaging is a daunting task for clinicians. Since the brain is the most vulnerable organ in CA, and severe brain injury remains the primary cause of death, thus monitoring of the brain function for prognostication purposes is of paramount importance. Electroencephalogram (EEG), either continuously or at specified time points, give the best direct access to the current brain function and the present sedation effects. However, the crucial differentiation between reversible sedation effects (affecting EEGs) and irreversible brain damage is a huge problem. In addition, the other prognostic markers also lack sensitivity and specificity, thereby leaving a significant portion of patients in uncertain prognostic grey areas. This underscores the imperative need to develop standardized rule-based assessment schemes with improved reliability to enhance prediction outcomes by mitigating uncertainty. \noindent This project aims to enhance neurological prognosis, and reduce uncertainty and ethical dilemmas in treating comatose survivors of CA by improving reliability of EEG assessments. To achieve this, we will develop multi-grading rule-based AI algorithms (see Fig. \ref{fig:concept}) that predict neurophysiological outcomes from heterogeneous longitudinal EEG data. These algorithms will: 1) identify discernible patterns that can distinguish highly malignant EEG patterns (HMEP) associated with sedation from those indicative of irreversible post-anoxic brain damage; 2) incorporate clinical and biochemical prognostic indicators to assess whether they further improve EEG-based outcome prediction; and 3) differentiate EEG patterns between likely awakeners and non-awakeners. Better prognostication holds the potential to markedly improve care and ethical decision-making among comatose CA survivors. Enabling tailored treatments can optimize resource allocation, curtails healthcare expenses, and mitigate premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) by reducing the impact of the game of chance through self-fulfilling prophecies. \begin{figure}[!h] \vspace{-0.5em} \centering \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/ProposalIDEA.pdf} \vspace{-0.6em} \caption{The envisioned concept to assess neurological outcomes} \label{fig:concept} \vspace{-1em} \end{figure} \section{Introduction} \noindent Annually, over 6 million CAs occur worldwide, with survival rates ranging from 1\% to 10\% \cite{graham2015strategies}. After resuscitation from CA, the majority of patients are comatose and treated at intensive care units (ICUs). Treatment regimes have varied, but standardized treatment including mechanical ventilation, sedation, and targeted temperature management (TTM, 33-37\degree C for at least 24 hours) are now recommended \cite{nolan2021european, dragancea2013influence}. The patients may gradually awaken after a time delay depending on the severity of the brain injury. Several different factors may individually prolong the effects of sedation and thus further complicate assessment. Severe brain injury is the primary cause of death, and the majority of patients die due to WLST decisions based on available clinical information and prognostication tools with suboptimal specificity. Current guidelines recommend a multimodal prognostication to be initiated 72 hours after CA in comatose survivors, acknowledging that several of these patients are still affected by sedation for different reasons. Based on the considered outcome (good or poor prognosis) both Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), pupillary light-(PLR), and corneal reflexes, Somato Sensory Evoked Potential (SSEP), and blood levels of Neuron Specific Enolase(NSE) over time are the main recommended predictors \cite{sandroni2022prediction, rossetti2017electroencephalography, bongiovanni2020standardized, ruijter2019early}. \noindent The fact that WLST leads to death with almost 100\% certainty, whereas the majority of survivors, even those awakening late, have a reasonably good long-term outcome is of major concern\cite{elmer2016association,nakstad2020late}. This disparity highlights the critical need for the development of reliable early brain assessment procedures. Additionally, the challenge of self-fulfilling prophecies presents a significant clinical problem. We have previously performed an observational study on comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients aiming to improve neurological prognostication and avoiding self-fulfilling prophecies and early WLST by blinding the prognostic parameters to the clinicians - the \textit{Norwegian Cardio-Respiratory Arrest Study} (NORCAST) \cite{nakstad2020late}. Most clinical parameters in NORCAST had too high false positive rate (FPR) for prognostication, and EEGs suitable for clinically meaningful prognostication were only available in less than half of the patients, mostly confounded by possible effects of sedatives\cite{nakstad2020late}. Of note, since the NORCAST trial, the treatment protocol for post-resuscitation care at OUS has changed on two central issues that might impact on prognostication: Change in TTM target from 33-37\degree C and change in sedation from the long-acting to more short-acting sedatives such as propofol. Both these factors are expected to have an impact on time to awakening \cite{paul2018comparison}. There is a clinical need to improve the assessment of comatose OHCA patients in light of the current changes in the treatment protocol. \noindent Undoubtedly, EEGs provide the best direct access to current brain function and sedation effects. However, the role of EEG assessment in this context is not yet firmly established, except for evaluating epileptic manifestations. Additionally, distinguishing between reversible sedation effects and irreversible brain damage remains challenging and leads to uncertainty. Thus, developing reliable AI-based algorithms for EEG assessment that can more accurately differentiate between these states would be a major advancement, enabling more efficient handling of extensive EEG data. Furthermore, the potential of using serial EEGs to monitor comatose patients has been underutilized. Implementing this approach holds the promise of enhancing our understanding of the awakening process and significantly improving the monitoring of brain function in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. \subsection{Scientific background and research gap} \noindent When using EEG for prognostication, reactive continuous EEG patterns with amplitude above 10 µV may serve as positive indicators for good prognosis. In contrast, suppression, or burst suppression, with or without discharges indicates a poor prognosis. An important knowledge gap and huge challenge regarding the prognostic accuracy of EEG includes the potential interference with direct sedation and clinical factors affecting sedation \cite{turella2024predictive,paul2018comparison}. \textbf{Need 1: To reliably differentiate EEG patterns affected and not affected by sedation.} \noindent EEG is one of the most used and available tools for assessing unconscious patients. The interpretation of HMEP vs. benign EEGs is due to several confounding factors, which highlights the importance of the experience of the interpreting neurophysiologist. Automating EEG interpretation through rule-based pattern recognition has the potential to improve accessibility and diagnostic accuracy in brain monitoring where experts are not readily available. Prior AI studies often lack the ability to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities, leading to reduced diagnostic accuracy \cite{tjepkema2019outcome, de2019predicting, nagaraj2018revised}. Hence, traditional machine and deep learning (DL) methods focusing on a single modality for automating EEG assessments must also be compared with additional information from clinical multi-modal markers in a multimodal framework to enhance/guide the reliability of EEG assessments \cite{vanat2023multimodal, tjepkema2019outcome, de2019predicting, nagaraj2018revised}. The inclusion of additional information in the model development can serve as a secondary voting scheme and check whether they further may improve the EEG-based outcome prediction \cite{grindegaard2022association}. \textbf{Need 2: Better and more automated tools to differentiate HMEP from benign patterns in EEG data followed by a comprehensive AI-based multimodal prognostic approach to enhance/guide the reliability of EEG assessments alone.} \noindent Further, we also lack studies on computational methods for predicting time-to-event (like time to awakening) in comatose patients. Such information could aid clinicians in tailoring individualized treatment plans where outcomes depend on many different and individual factors and would necessarily need to be based on repeated measures assessing the process over time. For this purpose, repeated automated EEG assessments seem promising and may, given information on sedation and termination of sedation, in addition give further information to enrich the EEG-based assessment of sedation versus irreversible brain damage. \textbf{Need 3: It is essential to analyze sequential EEG data over time to identify distinctive characteristics associated with imminent awakening compared to non-awakening in comatose CA survivors.} \subsection{Preliminary results} \noindent In NORCAST, 259 comatose OHCA survivors were included \cite{nakstad2020late}, with approximately half of the patients surviving with good outcome at six months. WLST was performed late (median 13 days after OHCA). Median time to awakening in those with good outcome was six days from the OHCA. Most clinical parameters had too high FPR for sufficient prognostication, but an absence of PLR and bilateral cortical N20 response in SSEP (both later than72 hrs after sedation withdrawal) as well as increased NSE levels above 80 µg/l differentiated poor/good outcome with FPR 0. We also found a strong association of non-reactive patterns in malignant EEG (burst suppression/epileptic activity/flat), but EEG was also largely impacted by sedation although it was performed no earlier than 72 hrs after sedation withdrawal. \\ \noindent In addition, our AI research group at the OUS, Intervention Centre (IVS) has been exploring DL transformers-based models to develop an open-source algorithm that predicts neurological outcomes in comatose post-CA patients using longitudinal EEG data \cite{qadir2023multi}. We used the open-source data from the \textbf{International Cardiac Arrest REsearch consortium (I-CARE)}; provided by George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023\footnote{\url{https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2023/}} for pilot development and validation, and achieved a True Positive Rate of 0.57 with FPR of $\leq$ 0.05, 72 hours after CA\cite{qadir2023multi}. \subsection{Impact} \noindent This research project aligns with Goal 1 of the research strategy of OUS for 2021-2025 \cite{OUS2021-2025} i.e., “Implement new models for clinical trials that take developments in personalised medicine into account, and include more interdisciplinary aspects in clinical trials.” Furthermore it aligns with Goal 3 i.e., “Facilitate the development and use of high-performance computing, including artificial intelligence, in both clinical research and translational research and also as a treatment tool.”, emphasizing multidisciplinary research for comprehensive data analysis that can contribute to the quality enhancement of public health. \textbf{Early prognosis through reliable prediction of EEG assessments and time-to-awakening in comatose patients after CA carries significant clinical and scientific impacts:} \begin{mylist2} \vspace{-0.9em} \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em} \myitem From a clinical perspective, an accurate early prognosis can enhance patient care by guiding clinicians in tailoring treatments to individual needs. This can optimize resource allocation and minimize harm by preventing premature WLST, reducing healthcare costs, ensuring ethical decision-making, and improving crucial discussions with close relatives. \myitem On the scientific front, this project holds significant potential to advance traditional machine and DL analysis to create a robust prognostic estimation tool with increased certainty towards neurological outcomes among comatose CA survivors. Developing sophisticated algorithms for interpreting EEG data can transform clinical decision-making, offering new insights into the intricate dynamics of post-anoxic coma. \vspace{-0.9em} \end{mylist2} \section{Hypotheses, aims and objectives} \noindent The long-term aim of our cross-disciplinary research network is to improve prognostic innovation that reduces uncertainty and ethical dilemmas in the treatment of comatose CA survivors, using standardized rule-based EEG assessment schemes with improved reliability. Automating these schemes with an AI approach will catalyze a paradigm shift in assessing neurological outcomes in comatose patients. Further, the incorporation of reliable prediction of time-to-events (i.e. time-to-awakening or non-awakening) following CA, transcends current practice for informed decision-making from a system based on binary classification, related to outcome at 6-12 months. \subsection{Hypothesis} \textbf{Our hypotheses are:} \begin{mylist3} \vspace{-0.9em} \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em} \item Rule-based pattern recognition can reliably differentiate EEG patterns affected and not affected by sedation. \item Rule-based pattern recognition can reliably differentiate HMEP from non-highly malignant patterns. \item Assessment of EEG patterns relevant for prognostication after CA can be automated through rule-based pattern recognition. \item A multimodal AI-based prognostic approach can enhance/guide reliability of EEG assessments when used alone to identify patients with both (good and poor) neurologic outcomes after CA. \item Early prediction of late-awakening from serial EEGs can mitigate self-fulling prophecies due to premature WLST. \vspace{-0.9em} \end{mylist3} \subsection{Specific Aims} %\noindent \textbf{Our aims are}: \begin{mylist1} \vspace{-0.1em} \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em} \myitem Our study aims to improve the prognostic accuracy of a multi-grading rule-based EEG algorithm extended with a multi-modal approach to potentially influence current clinical practice, namely focusing on both good and poor (as opposed to the currently used only poor) outcomes in comatose CA survivors. \myitem We also aim to address another important and understudied issue with the potential to influence current clinical practice, namely focusing on the prediction of time-to-awakening, as opposed to the current practice of perceived poor outcome for late-awakening. \vspace{-0.9em} \end{mylist1} \subsection{Specific Objectives} %\noindent \textbf{Our objectives are}: \begin{mylist} \vspace{-0.1em} \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em} \myitem Design a multi-grading rule-based EEG assessment scheme to identify markers of HMEP, controlling for sedative effects. \myitem Extend multi-grading rule-based EEG assessment scheme for multi-modal scenarios using a model combining clinical variables like GCS, brain stem reflexes, EEG pattern recognition, and NSE levels. Further, the reliability of EEG assessments for neuro prognostication is investigated with the AI-based multimodal approaches. \myitem Test feasibility of prospective study where early WLST is avoided while time-series assessment of EEG patterns after sedation-withdrawal are added, and predictions are kept blinded to the treatment team (similar to the previous NORCAST trial with a different TTM- and sedation regimen). Further design an AI framework that makes predictions over time, which are phrased in terms of either time- to-event outcomes (time-to-awakening/ non-awakening) across multiple time horizons (e.g., within the next 24, 48, or 72 hours). \vspace{-0.9em} \end{mylist} \section{Project Methodology} \subsection{Project arrangements, method selection, and analyses} \noindent The proposed work is divided into five work packages (WPs) (see Fig. \ref{fig:WP}). \textbf{\textcolor{purple} {WP1}} outlines studies for the development of a multi-grading rule-based EEG pattern-recognition algorithm adjusting for sedation effects to reduce uncertainty in neurophysiological interpretation (\textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{H.1-3}}) leading to reduce both FPR and FNR for the considered type of neuro prognostication. \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP2}} details extension of the proposed multi-graded rule-based EEG assessment algorithm (WP1) for multi-modal scenarios (\textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{H.4}}), using a model combining EEG pattern recognition, NSE and standardized neurological scoring (GCS and brain stem reflexes). \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP3}} is a prospective feasibility study where early WLST is avoided while time-series assessment of EEG patterns after sedation-stop are added, while predictions are kept blinded to the treatment team (\textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{H.5}}). Further, design an AI framework that makes predictions over time, which are phrased in terms of either time-to-event outcomes (time-to-awakening or non-awakening). \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP4}} is for dissemination, communication, and exploitation. \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP5}} is for project management. \noindent \textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{Datasets:}} \\ Two out of three planned studies are designed for retrospective data analysis. For pilot development of rule-based schemes followed by validation of AI algorithms under investigation in the project, we \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth} \vspace{-2em} \begin{center} \includegraphics[trim=0.0cm 0.0cm 0.0cm 0.0cm, clip=true, width=0.59\textwidth]{figures/WPS.pdf} \end{center} \vspace{-1.85em} \caption{\footnotesize WP organization and interaction} \label{fig:WP} \vspace{-1.3em} \end{wrapfigure} will use a unique database from OUS consisting of 10,000 consecutive EEGs from 2017-2022 annotated using the SCORE nomenclature. This data is annotated as a part of a clinical routine using HOLBERG Score software and consists of all types of EEGs not restricted to EEGs from the ICUs. In NORCAST \cite{nakstad2020late}, GCS, PLR, corneal reflexes and use of sedatives were registered daily in all comatose patients. EEG and SSEP were registered, during the first 24 hrs during TTM 33\degree C (if available) and 72h after discontinuation of sedation. NSE values were drawn from blood at 0,24,48,72,120, and 144 hrs after OHCA. Neuroimaging included CT and MRI on days 5-7. Primary outcome was assessed at six months using the cerebral performance category (CPC) to dichotomize patients into good or poor outcome. \noindent \textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{WP1: Multi-grading rule-based EEG pattern recognition algorithm \textbf{;} }} \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Leader:} Nilsen \\ \textbf{Contributors:} Lundqvist, Sunde, Andersen, Qadir, Balasingham\textbf{;} \textbf{Personnel:} Postdoc, Ph.D., Nurse} \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Aims and Objectives:}} \noindent A retrospective study using our EEG database is designed to yield an automated multi-grading rule-based EEG assessment scheme describing and grading normal and pathological EEG patterns controlling for sedative effects.\\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 1.1: Establish project-specific database}} \\ A project-specific dataset will be established by combining information on sedation (yes/no) and EEG features annotated using the SCORE nomenclature in collaboration with Nurse. The combined annotation for the EEG recordings will have the following multilevel grading groups: \textit{Non-sedated/Non-malignant, Sedated/Non-malignant, Non-sedated/Highly Malignant, Sedated/Highly Malignant}. Here, the \textit{Non-Sedated/Non-Malignant} group defines the (Control Group for study Population) good prognosis and the other three groups describe the pathological EEG patterns towards poor prognosis.\\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 1.2: AI model development for assessment of EEG patterns relevant for prognostication}} \\ The raw EEGs annotated in Task 1.1 are used to develop three AI-based models: two for binary classification and one for four-class categorization. The first binary classification model determines whether the patient is sedated or not, while the second distinguishes between highly malignant and benign conditions. The third model is a four-class categorization system that classifies EEG data into one of four categories: non-sedated/non-malignant, sedated/non-malignant, non-sedated/highly malignant, and sedated/highly malignant. \\ \noindent Transformer networks (TNs) with attention mechanisms (AMs) \cite{vaswani2017attention} have recently become prominent in natural language processing, largely due to their scalability and their ability to build attention maps that identify correlations between words (tokens). Their versatility and robustness have led to their adaptation in various advanced applications, including ChatGPT. Given these strengths, TNs present an intriguing avenue for further exploration of time-series EEG data, as they can be leveraged to uncover complex patterns and relationships both within individual EEG channels (intra-channel) and between different channels (inter-channel).\\ \noindent In our approach, we will segment EEG recordings into n-second windows, transforming these segments into tokens. This allows our customized TN to process the data and build an attention maps. Tokenization of segments facilitates TN to identify complex correlations within the EEG signals. To capture the complex relationships within EEG data, the AM can be customized to focus on both local and global interactions. This involves creating a multi-head AM of TN where different heads are designed to analyze localized patterns within adjacent segments as well as broader patterns across multiple segments. Additionally, considering that EEG data are collected from multiple channels (electrodes), the AM can be tailored to emphasize inter-channel relationships, allowing the model to prioritize and learn from the most informative channels for specific neurological conditions. \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 1.3: Clinical advisory on the model development and internal validation}}\\ \noindent Close collaboration during the development of the AI algorithms and evaluation of intermediate results will be required. The clinical Ph.D. researcher will assist Postdoc(AI) in verifying the developed rule-based algorithm based on the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) grading. Internal Validation of the developed models from \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1, 2}} will be performed using a similar approach described in the recent study published in JAMA Neurology \cite{tveit2023automated}. We will test the models on the withheld validation set (not included in the development phase).\\ \noindent To aid the clinical Ph.D. researcher in evaluating and validating the model's classification outputs, a key aspect will be developing a visualization tool incorporating several key features. Attention heatmaps \cite{kim2024towards} will be used to display the attention weights across different EEG segments, highlighting which time points or channels are most influential in the model's predictions. Interactive time-series plots will allow clinicians to explore model predictions in relation to the raw EEG data, providing insights into how predictions align with observed patterns. Channel-wise contribution graphs will illustrate the relative importance of various EEG channels, helping to identify which channels are critical for detecting specific conditions. \begin{center} \vspace{-1.6em} \centering \small \label{tab:my_label} \begin{longtable}{|m{16.6cm}|} \hline \rowcolor{green!15} {\textbf{Expected results and deliverables:} \textbf{D1.1:} Project-specific database (M6);\textbf{D1.2:} Multi-grading rule-based EEG pattern recognition algorithm (M18); \textbf{D1.3:} Dev. of three AI models (M24). \textbf{Target:} 1 Conf. paper (IEEE-EMBC); 3 Journal papers (IEEE-TPAMI, Pattern Recognition, Resuscitation-Elsevier)} \\ \hline \end{longtable} \vspace{-4.25em} \end{center} \noindent \textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{WP2: Extend multi-grading rule-based assessment scheme for multi-modal scenarios\textbf{;} }} \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Leader:} Nakstad \textbf{Contributors:} Lundqvist, Sunde, Qadir, Nesaragi\textbf{;} \textbf{Personnel:} Postdoc, Ph.D., Nurse} %\end{flushleft} \label{WP1} \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Aims and Objectives:}} \noindent A retrospective study using the NORCAST database is designed in collaboration with Nurse to yield an automated multi-grading rule-based EEG assessment similar to \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1}} but extended for multi-modal scenarios using a model combining EEG pattern recognition, NSE at 24, 48 and 72 hrs, and clinical variables like GCS, PLR, and corneal reflexes. \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Tasks: Establish a Project-specific multi-modal database and develop multi-modal AI models relevant for prognostication}}\\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 2.1}} First, a project-specific EEG dataset will be established by combining rudimentary information on sedation (yes/no) and HMEP annotated using the SCORE nomenclature adapting data from NORCAST. \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 2.2}} A similar design of three AI models is carried out as in \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1}}. Next, we map the above multi-level graded labeling with four groups to binary prognostication outcome (good vs poor). Here, the EEG modality approach described in \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1}} will be extended to a multimodal framework incorporating the additional data sources. Each data modality will represent different aspects of neurological function in the TN architecture. The EEG data will continue to be processed and tokenized as previously outlined, while the additional modalities will be encoded as supplementary input features. These inputs will be synchronized with the EEG segments based on the alignment and relevance to the clinical condition being studied. To handle the multimodal inputs, the AM within the TN will be extended to simultaneously focus on intra-modality (e.g., EEG-specific patterns) and inter-modality interactions (e.g., relationships between EEG signals and clinical variables). This will involve designing specialized heads within the multi-head AM of TN, where some heads are dedicated to identifying correlations within individual modalities, while others focus on cross-modality interactions. By customizing the AM in this manner, the TN will be equipped to capture complex, high-dimensional relationships across the different data types. \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 2.3}} Similar steps relevant to clinical advisory on the model development and internal validation will be followed as in \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1}}. In addition, comparison between the single-modality (EEG-only) and the multimodal model will be conducted by evaluating their performance on the same classification tasks. We will assess the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The goal of multi-modal prognostication is to use additional information from other modalities to validate EEG assessments. This information can serve as a secondary voting scheme to further enhance/guide the EEG reliability/assessment in neuro-prognostication. \begin{center} \vspace{-1.6em} \centering \small \label{tab:my_label} \begin{longtable}{|m{16.6cm}|} \hline \rowcolor{green!15} {\textbf{Expected results and deliverables:} \textbf{D2.1:} Project-specific database (M18); \textbf{D2.2:} Multi-grading assessment scheme for multi-modal scenarios (M30); and \textbf{D2.3:} Improve the rule-based EEG algorithm from WP1 using additional information from other modalities(M36). \textbf{Target:} 1 congress (ISICEM); 2 Journal Papers (IEEE-JBHI, Physiological Measurement)} \hline \end{longtable} \vspace{-3.0em} \end{center} \noindent \textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{WP3: Feasibility of using serial EEGs (after terminated sedation) to improve differentiation of sedation from established brain damage - A prospective study in the ICU\textbf{;} }} \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Leader:} Sunde\textbf{;} \textbf{Contributors:} Lundqvist, Andersen, Qadir, Nesaragi\textbf{;} \textbf{Personnel:} Postdoc, Ph.D., Soft. Developer}\\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Aims and Objectives:}} Collection of serial EEGs time-locked to termination of sedation and throughout the awakening process. Clinical data on awakening, sedation level, and prognostic predictors will be collected in parallel.\\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 3.1: Study Design and Feasibility Evaluation}} \\ \noindent A project-specific dataset will be established prospectively over one year in the ICU with daily EEGs collected in comatose CA survivors until the patient is either awake or dead. In addition to EEGs, detailed medication data will be collected by access to the ICU's electronic clinical information system. Other prognostic markers will be collected (NSE, GCS, daily brainstem reflexes, SSEP, and brain CT/MRI when available). The EEGs will be assessed using the algorithms developed in \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1,2}}. Results of the daily EEGs performed as part of the study will be blinded to the treating physicians except for evidence of ongoing epileptic activity. Routine EEGs performed on clinical indication will, of course, not be blinded. Based on ICU admission data and our experience from the NORCAST we suggest it to be possible to collect serial EEG data from 20-30 patients in one year. With a mean of 5 serial EEGs per patient this will give 100-150 EEGs.\\ \noindent Feasibility evaluation is performed by qualitative and quantitative research design aiming to address feasibility for safe implementation of AI. Qualitative retrospective focus group interviews of ICU physicians and attending staff will answer the question of whether the rule-based serial EEG assessment has the potential to affect physicians’ trust and confidence to prognostic evaluations. The logistics and feasibility of implementation of the system in further large-scale prospective studies and clinical routine will also be addressed by Soft. developer. Analyses will be by systematic text condensation \cite{malterud2012systematic}. \noindent Quantitatively we will estimate whether the addition of algorithm-based serial EEG assessment is likely to strengthen clinicians’ trust and accuracy in outcome predictions and whether it may affect WLST decisions compared to today's standard. This will be done by comparing actual clinical decisions vs. retrospective consensus evaluation using the additional data from the serial EEGs. \\ \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Task 3.2: AI framework for early prediction of time to event}} \\ \noindent An AI framework is designed that can learn to find distinguishable patterns for both awakening and non-awakening patients from the serial EEGs collected in \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{Task 3.1}} to predict time-to-event (awakening or non-awakening). In this task, we will expand the AI model from \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1, 2}} to predict probabilities of patient awakening or mortality across various time intervals (e.g., 24, 48, or 72 hours). Temporal markers will be transformed into time-based probability distributions, serving as labels to fine-tune the AI model from \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{WP1, 2}}. This approach compels the AI model to discover relevant patterns across data modalities and distinguish distinctive characteristics within the learned features of both groups. \begin{center} \vspace{-1.6em} \centering \small \label{tab:my_label} \begin{longtable}{|m{16.6cm}|} \hline \rowcolor{green!15} {\textbf{Expected results and deliverables:} \textbf{D3.1:} Establish feasibility of introducing automated serial EEG assessments in future prospective studies and clinical practice (M30); \textbf{D3.2:}improve the rule-based EEG algorithm from WP1 and WP2 (M36); 3 Journal papers (Critical Care Medicine, Resuscitation-Elsevier, JAMIA). \hline \end{longtable} \vspace{-4.0em} \end{center} \subsection{Participants, organization and collaborations} \noindent The Ph.D., Postdoc, Nurse and Software Researcher will collaborate with the highly cross-disciplinary expert team, covering all aspects of the project with clear synergies between groups.

The group will provide feedback on the study design, key research, and ethical questions regarding neuro-prognostication and survivors' quality of life. %\vspace{-0.8em} \section{Ethical considerations} \vspace{-0.5em} \noindent The project will comply with Norwegian legislation and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity on research ethics and data protection by following the policies given by OUS. During the recruitment process, we ensure that individuals will be treated fairly regardless of age, disability, race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. Data from NORCAST trial will be used in accordance with the approval from the Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics South East Norway: REK-S-O/A-2010/1116a. Similar ethical and security measures will be taken for any prospective data that might be collected. Data will be stored on secure servers approved by the Data Protection Officer at OUS with all patient-specific information removed, fully anonymized and unidentifiable. We will ensure that the AI inference will not interfere with decision-making or surgical progress at any stage, ensuring optimal safety for the comatose patients.
